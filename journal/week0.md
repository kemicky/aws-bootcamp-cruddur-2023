 >> - Created all the accounts needed and set them up accordingly. 

 ### Conceptual (Napkin) Diagram: Cruddur MicroBlogging WebApp.
 > #### Date: 15th Feb 2022:
 >> - First, I designed a rough cruddur napkin diagram with pen and paper to get some visual understanding and brainstorm:

 >> - Then, I designed a clean cruddur napkin diagram with Lucid Charts:

I was able to design the above conceptual drawing by using:
1. the information given about the project in the week 0 instruction video.
2. reading more on what a microblogging site is and how it works.
3. asking myself the dumb questions like:
   - what will the client's minimal viable product(MVP) of this microblogging site be ?.
   - how do I show the technicality behind the MicroBlog App diagrammatically that will be easy for all involved stakeholders on the project to understand ?.
   - what are the most important functionalities the supposed user(s) of the MicroBlog App will need ?.
 
However, with the understanding that to design the diagram, I have to make:
 - it clear to read and consise as much as possible
 - easy to understand by the various stakeholders who maybe involved in the project as some of them might not be technically orientated at all.

### Architecture Diagram: Cruddur MicroBlogging WebApp.
 > #### Date: 16th Feb 2022:
 >> - I recreated and designed cruddur architecture diagram with Lucid Charts:

- Watched the week 0 - instruction video and took some other initiative to design my own architecture of the app and as well keeping the cost as low as possible in mind.
Also making the architecture a little more technically oriented to enhance the design and developement of the app's internal features which may be more easy to understand for the developers and engineers working on the design and development of the app.
